# Student-marks-analysis
exploratory analysis

In this analysis project, we aim to investigate how various factors influence student scores. We are examining patterns related to four key variables: parents' education levels, parents' marital status, students' participation in sports, and students' involvement in test preparation programs. By analyzing these factors, we seek to identify any significant correlations or trends that may impact student performance. Our goal is to understand how these variables interact and contribute to students' academic outcomes, providing insights that could inform strategies for improving student achievement and support.
